Comics on a budget
-----------

You just can't enter in a bookstore or in a comicstore if you're short on money.
Comics On A Budget can help you: insert the maximum price, insert the 
price of the books/comics you want to buy
and this little js application will tell you which books you can buy and which not.

This application is designed with smartphones in mind.

Live Demo?

I suggest you to try the webapp with a phone or a tablet.

Do I need an yolo-uber-octaphone to run it?

This application is tested on mid-power phones (512MB RAM, 1GHz CPU, 4" screen) and with a shitty browser, so... don't worry: if 
it's fast for me, it will be fast for everyone.
