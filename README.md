Debit Comic
-----------

You just can't enter in a bookstore or in a comicstore if you're short on money.
Debit Comic can help you: insert the maximum price, insert the price of the books/comics you want to buy
and this little js application will tell you which books you can buy and which not.

This application is designed with smartphones in mind.

Do I need an yolo-uber-octaphone to run it?
------------

This application is tested on mid-power phones (512MB RAM, 1GHz CPU, 4" screen) and with a shitty browser, so... don't worry: if 
it's fast for me, it will be fast for everyone.
